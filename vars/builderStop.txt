Stops `stackname` resources, saving money.

Optional 'resources' supports a list containing:
- `ec2`
- `rds`

You probably want to take a lock on `stackname` first to avoid conflicting with the builds that use it - that way if a build is running while this step is called, the step will have to wait.
