Checks if `stackname` is nearly at the end of a billing hour, and if so stops its nodes to save money while the instance is not being used.

You probably want to take a lock on `stackname` first to avoid conflicting with the builds that use it - that way if a build is running while this step is called, the step will have to wait and possibly spill over to the next hour. In that case the instance will be kept alive as it will be already paid for another hours.
