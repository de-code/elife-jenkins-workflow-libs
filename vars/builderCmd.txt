Executes `cmd` on `stackname`. Depends on BUILDER_PATH environment variable.

Optionally specify a `folder` in which to execute the command, to use as the working directory.

Optionally specify to `captureOutput`, in which case the output of the command will be returned rather than printed. Only stdout is considered output; stderr will still be printed.
