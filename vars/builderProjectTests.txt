Executes a `project_tests.sh` inside `folder` on `stackname`. The script may fail, but this does not interrupt the build to allow retrieval of the JUnit-formatted XML log.

Pass `propagateFailure=true` to instead make the failure immediate.

`builderSmokeTests` is also executed, and its (possible) failure will be propagated to the build, as smoke tests normally do not produce an XML log.
