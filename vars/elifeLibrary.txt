Similar to `elifePipeline`, but makes the code run on a specialized `libraries` node and cleans up right after the build has finished to avoid pull requests occupying too much disk space.

The node will be brought up automatically and connected as a slave if it's not already in this state. A label is used to assign the contents of the job to the node. A lock will be held for the duration of the builds that prevents the node being stopped as long as something is running on it.
