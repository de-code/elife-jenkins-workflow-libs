Builds image of `project` from the current folder, tagging it with `commit`. Usually the `organization` is just `elifesciences`.

`Dockerfile.ci` is used by this process, as well as the `myimage:${commit}` tagged base image to start from. The resulting image is named `myimage_ci` and is never pushed.
