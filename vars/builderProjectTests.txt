Executes tests inside `folder` on `stackname`. The script may fail, and the error will propagate up.

The source of tests are:

- a `project_tests.sh` script
- any script that is found inside a `.ci/` folder

All source are optional, but at least one entry must be found.

Pass `testArtifacts=['/srv/journal/build/behat.xml', ...]` to specify a list of test artifacts to process with `builderTestArtifact`, when they exist. Even when a failure is happening, an attempt to retrieve these artifacts till still be made.

`builderSmokeTests` is also executed, and its (possible) failure will be propagated to the build as per the other tests.

Separate commit statuses are produced for each check, named `continuous-integration/jenkins/...`.
