Executed the `elife-spectrum` end2end tests, which connect the various projects.

Since end2end tests needs to be run only for one project at a time, this step will take a lock over the `end2end` resource, describing the cluster of machines ending whose names match `*--end2end`.

Accepts a `preliminaryStep` closure as an argument, to be run on the node. For example, this step can be used to deploy the current project to the `end2end` environment so that its deploy cannot be concurrent with end2end tests that are running for other projects.

Accepts a second `marker` optional parameter, which can be used to filter the end2end tests that cover the project under test. The marker is passed in as a py.test `-m` parameter.
