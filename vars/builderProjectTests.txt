Executes a `project_tests.sh` inside `folder` on `stackname`. The script may fail, and the error will propagate up.

TODO: Will also execute, in parallel with the `project_tests.sh` script, any script that is found inside a `project_tests/` folder.

Pass `testArtifacts=['/srv/journal/build/behat.xml', ...]` to specify a list of test artifacts to process with `builderTestArtifact`, when they exist. Even when a failure is happening, an attempt to retrieve these artifacts till still be made.

`builderSmokeTests` is also executed, and its (possible) failure will be propagated to the build as per the other tests.
