Makes sure `stackname` is started and ready for new deployments. Idempotent.

BEWARE: you shouldn't need to call this, you are probably looking for `builderDeployRevision` for a project or `elifeLibrary` for a library. These two will make sure the right stacks are running before executing the build. Only use this directly if you know what you're doing.
