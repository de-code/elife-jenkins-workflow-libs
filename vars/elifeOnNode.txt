Makes code run on a specialized libraries Jenkins node and cleans up right after the build has finished to avoid pull requests occupying too much disk space.

The node will be brought up automatically and connected, if it's not already in this state. A label is used to assign the contents of the job to the node. A lock will be held for the duration of the builds that prevents the node being stopped as long as something is running on it.

Optionally, `nodeName` can be used to select the specific the build needs to run on if there are multiple libraries nodes.
