Sends a commit status notification for the `commit`, which needs to originate from Github or to have been previously pushed there.

`commit` is a sha.
`status` is usually `success` or `failure`.
`context` is what is checked by Github for required commit statuses, like `continuous-integration/jenkins/pr-head`.
`description` is free text that will appear in the pull request, if there is one.
